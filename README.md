# Cryptocurrency_Prediction

I implemented a recurrant neural network using LSTM layers to predict the value of a cryptocurrency named litecoin based on past trends.

I used this data set from kaggle to train the neural net: https://www.kaggle.com/jessevent/all-crypto-currencies

It has historical values for more than 2000 crypto tokens over 13 variables such as open, high, low, and close price. It can be used to train the neural network for any crypto token.

I used this model as a reference: https://towardsdatascience.com/cryptocurrency-prediction-with-lstm-4cc369c43d1b
